Refer [RavenM](/en/Projects/ravenm.md)

When you can see a line of RavenM message at the left-down corner of game window, RavenM is installed successfully.

**Remember to check updates on our github page, re-installing enquals updating.**

## Join&create a lobby

Open Instant Action Menu, press `M` to open the multi-player ui:


`HOST` is creating a lobby, while `JOIN` is joining a lobby.

Click `HOST`, you can edit some props of new lobby:

Props details:

| Props | Details |
|------|------|
| `LOBBY NAME` | The name of this lobby |
| `MEMBER LIMIT` | Max members in the lobby (min is `2`) |
| `FRIENDS ONLY` | Only your steam friends can join the lobby? |
| `SHOW ON LOBBY LIST` | Show the lobby in public lobby list? otherwise others can only join it by lobby id |
| `JOINABLE MIDGAME ` | Can players join the game after the game is started?( Yes default is off because we aren't sure if it will cause extra bugs) |
| `ENABLE GOD INSPECT ` | Can players press `F8` to open inspect camera? |
| `ENABLE WALLHACK ` | Can players press `F7` to show others position in game? |
| `NAMETAGS ` | Whether to show a nametag above each player's head, and is it only for same team(Eagle/Raven)? |
| `LOBBY NOTE ` | Additional message for this lobby, will show in lobby info before join the lobby |

Click `START`, will enter pre-gaming ui, click `LEAVE` to close lobby (return from map will not close the lobby), your friends can directly join the lobby by the lobby id:

![Pre-gaming ui](https://ravenfieldcommunity.github.io/docs-img/in-GAME/ravenm.003.en.png)

You can configure other things like vehicles as normal (Bots still will spawn in game. non-host players can only select teams), then `START` to start game.

Click `JOIN`, one way is joining from lobby list, another one is from lobby id.

Select a lobby, you can see the info and join the lobby (if the plugin and game is different, you can't join it).	

Colors of member name stand for member status (`green`=readyï¼Œ`red`=loading mods, `grey or yellow`=in respawn cd time).
