## Description

Here we provide some dependencies for Ravenfield's BepInEX pulgin dev.

## Usage

:::tip
Recommended to use these packages with BepInEX official's nuget packages, command:
```sh
dotnet add package UnityEngine.Modules --version 2020.3.48 -s https://nuget.bepinex.dev/v3/index.json
```
:::

Run following dotnet CLI commands to add packages (default is latest version):
```sh
dotnet add package Ravenfield.GameLibs
dotnet add package Ravenfield.ThirdpartyLibs
```
Then you're recommended to add something to the similar lines in your project config (`.csproj`) like:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Ravenfield.GameLibs" Version="0.XX.X" IncludeAssets="compile" />
<PackageReference Include="Ravenfield.ThirdpartyLibs" Version="0.XX.X" IncludeAssets="compile" />
```

Yes add property `IncludeAssets="compile"` so that the game dlls will not be exported while building your project.
